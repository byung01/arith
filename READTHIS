Missing Arith Submission
========================

Dear Professor Mendelsohn and Comp 40 Course Staff,

On October 29, 2015, my partner Theodore Tan and I, Bill Yung, received an email
regarding our missing arith submission. Unfortunately, we could not find the
original files for our first arith submission. The most recently saved files
were the original arith files we have overwritten to complete the arith
challenge. At the request of Professor Mendelsohn, we changed our files back to
what we had in our original arith files and re-submitted. The only files that
we changed was pack40.c and the compile script. We defined macros on lines 33 to
50 in pack40.c and those were the only lines that were modified in our code to
complete the challenge.

Due to the minimal number of lines that we modified for the arith challenge, we
can affirm and verify that what we have re-submitted is exactly the same as our
original submission on October 22, 2015, at around midnight.

Sorry for the inconvenience,
Theodore Tan and Bill Yung
